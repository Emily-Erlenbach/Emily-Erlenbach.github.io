# Website repository

This repository contains all the code and content necessary for my website. 
The original code for the website relies on the [Ed](http://minicomp.github.io/ed) theme and is available [here](https://github.com/minicomp/ed).
The code was modified mostly to remove the sidebar and instead place the links at the top of the page.



## Ed

[Ed](http://minicomp.github.io/ed) is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme designed for textual editors based on [minimal computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/) principles, and focused on legibility, durability, ease and flexibility. To learn how to install and begin using Ed, please visit the [documentation page](http://minicomp.github.io/ed/documentation).
